<p>
 What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
 </p>

<p>
She believes that it’s wrong to say that you are either a user or a developer, hence everyone is
a user and that users are programmers too! She goes on to say that as users we need to learn
and understand programming and that computer education should change from managing apps
to writing apps!

<p>
What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
</p>

<p>
According to Lilalina the ideal internet user is a general purpose user as in the people that are
always adjusting, improving and some time taking control to make better technologies. She
goes on to explain how they are driven to challenge the internet as they create and develop
technology subconsciously and continuously. Just as they push the internet to fill new needs by
asking “what we can do and what can computers do?”

<p>
From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there
e are "gaps that can be filled by users"?
</p>

<p>
My experience leads me to believe that as a designer I need to understand programming and
coding as I begin to look at incorporate UX and UI. HHI think that in gaining a deeper
understanding of the coding and programing I need to bridge the user experience and user
interface to form a much more comfortable experience for the general user!
